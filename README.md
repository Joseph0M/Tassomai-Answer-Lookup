### About TAL:
 
Tassomai, a Leading Science homework website, provides schools and indviduals with revision and homework resources. The Answer lookup program provides you with all of Tassomai's Science related questions.

It supports about 95% of science related questions found on Tassomai currently. Formed from the inspration of Gloryness' hit software, Tassomai Automation. The program is based on an on-device database model, so the code will never call on APIs. 

The most stable release at the time of writing is v1.2.1 but it is still quite buggy. feel free to add to this repo and create pull requests
