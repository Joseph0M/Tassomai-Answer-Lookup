# Tassomai-Awnser-Finder
Just enter your question and boom, it returns your awnser!

Run the `find.exe` file, enter the full question and click find, the program will return the complete awnser!
Most, if not all questions are listed on the database

Due to formatting limitations, about 10% of the tasssomai questions cannot be read/illegible, mostly Physics questions!
